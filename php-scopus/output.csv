There are several classical adaptive filters that have been used as a stand alone approach for linear acoustic echo cancellation(AEC). A common assumption in most AEC techniques is that the echo path is linear. However, in real scenarios, owing to distortions introduced by other acoustic artefacts in handheld devices, the echo path is nonlinear. Therefore, there is a need to employ a nonlinear echo canceller. In this paper, a kernel expansion on a family of adaptive filtering algorithms based on least mean square filter is proposed. Kernel methods help model the nonlinear echo path and attain global minimum easily by finding the optimal set of filter weights. The simulations are carried out for speech signal with and without noise under different signal-to-noise ratio values. The results show that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in a nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation environment in terms of echo return loss enhancement.","10.1016/j.apacoust.2020.107329","0003682X","||Sankar S.||Kar A.::0000-0003-0011-0069::600||Burra S.||SWAMY M.||Mladenovic V.::0000-0001-8530-2312::600","Article","85082684331","2020-09-01"

Dummy molecularly imprinted polymer (DMIP) was prepared towards bisphenol S and bisphenol F employing bisphenol A as a dummy template. Liquid chromatography with UV and fluorescence detection (LC-UV/FLD) was used for the separation and quantification of these analytes. The maximum adsorption capacity of DMIP was 20.9 mg g−1 and 18.6 mg g−1 for BPS and BPF, respectively. By applying solid phase extraction with DMIP prior to LC-UV/FLD, the limits of detections achieved in food samples can be lowered to 0.5 ng g−1 for BPF and 5 ng g−1 for BPS. Only 5 mg of DMIP sorbent was sufficient to achieve good recoveries (71–113%) and precision (RSD 0.1–3.2%, n = 3) for analyzed liquid food samples spiked at two concentration levels 0.25 mg L −1 and 0.40 mg L −1. For preconcentrated pineapple extract spiked with 0.5 mg•L −1 of both analytes, also very good recovery was obtained (89% for BPS and 99% for BPF), significantly higher than for conventional SPE cartridges such as Oasis HLB and Affinimip®. The analytical characterization of the proposed method makes it suitable for monitoring programs, intended for the assessment of human exposure to bisphenol S in food samples, without using much expensive mass spectrometry detection.","10.1016/j.microc.2020.104836","0026265X","||Kubiak A.||Cirić A.::0000-0002-5698-5510::600||Biesaga M.::0000-0001-6839-6740::600","Article","85082686057","2020-07-01"

Novel bioactive ferrocene containing chalcone derivative (E)-3-(2-methylpyrimidin-5-yl)-1-ferroceynlprop-2-en-1-one (MPFP) were synthesized by Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction method. A full scale exploration on the intramolecular charge transfer of a bioactive ferrocenylchalcone derivative, from a strong electron-donor (ferrocene) to an electron-acceptor (pyrimidine) through the π-conjugated bridge (α-β-unsaturated carbonyl) has been carried out from their IR and Raman spectra. The vibrational spectra supported by the density functional theory computations have been employed to analyse the effect of intramolecular charge transfer on the stabilized geometries and the vibrational modes contributing to the bioactivity of the synthesized compound. Natural bond and natural population analysis have also been carried out to analyse the effects of intramolecular charge transfer, C–H⋯O hydrogen bonding, conjugation and hyperconjugative interactions on the stabilized geometries. Molecular electrostatic potentials have also been discussed. The synthesized compound were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria by agar well disc diffusion method.

Since its inception in 2003, Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation journal has come a long way over the past 18 years. Possibly much longer than many of its contemporaries in the blossoming science of health economics might have anticipated. Today, entering 2020 it celebrates the Age of Maturity. We believe that in the third decade of XXI century the interdisciplinary science of health economics, will rejuvenate and come back to us younger than ever from its early historical roots almost a century ago. The spreading of economic globalization in several distinctive ways, either led by multinational business corporations or newly emerged Asian leadership, or both, is likely to make challenges for contemporary health systems far more serious. The fourth industrial revolution (cyber physical systems and artificial intelligence technology) and accelerated innovation in the field of E-Health and digital health, will probably change the workflow in medical and health care, and inevitably transform the labour market in the upcoming decades. So, let us be up to the task. Let us provide academic centres, industry-sponsored pharmaceutical and medical device innovation hubs, and governing authorities alike, with a powerful forum for debate on cost-effective resource allocation in the years to come.","10.1186/s12962-020-00210-2","","||Jakovljevic M.::0000-0002-9160-6846::600||Matter-Walstra K.||Sugahara T.||Sharma T.||Reshetnikov V.::0000-0002-7853-7356::600||Merrick J.||Yamada T.||Youngkong S.||Rovira J.","Review","85082758828","2020-04-02"

A large number of species belonging to the genus Teucrium are used in pharmacy and traditional medicine for the treatment of different diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the polyphenolic composition as well as genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of methanolic extracts from T. arduini and T. flavum, two native species found in Montenegro. We determined the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of these plants using spectrophotometric methods; the qualitative content of polyphenolic compounds was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Genotoxicity in cultured human lymphocytes was measured in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN) and comet assay in the range between 125 and 1000 μg/mL. Cytotoxicity was assessed by the MTT viability assay in normal human MRC-5 fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. The content of total phenolics and flavonoids in T. arduini extract was higher than in T. flavum (200.35 mg GA/g vs. 171.08 mg GA/g; 96.32 mg RU/g vs. 78.14 mg RU/g). The polyphenolic composition of both extracts was qualitatively similar and eight phenol compounds were identified. The most commonly present phenol was caffeic acid and among four flavonoids, the most common was quercetin. Both plant extracts were genotoxic in both the CBMN and comet assays at concentrations of 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL. After 72 h of exposure, the extracts of T. arduini and T. flavum were found to induce cytotoxicity in MRC-5 fibroblasts but not in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The results suggest that the constituents of both plant species are genotoxic and cytotoxic, therefore these extracts warrant additional evaluation to be safely applied in humans.","10.1016/j.mrgentox.2020.503168","13835718","||Grujicic D.::0000-0001-7955-6076::600||Markovic A.||Vukajlović J.||Stankovíc M.||Jakovljević M.||Cirić A.::0000-0002-5698-5510::600||Djordjević K.||Planojević N.||Curcic M.::0000-0002-5075-5650::600||Milošević-Djordjević O.::0000-0002-5049-135X::600","Article","85082142799","2020-04-01"

Objective: Nurses represent the key persons in the process of organ donation, acting as intermediaries between the patient and the family of a potential donor. The aim of this study was to analyze the factors influencing the attitudes of nurses toward bequeathing and organ and tissue donation. Methods: The research was designed as a cross-sectional study from November 2013 to November 2014 and included a sample of 264 nurses employed in the health system of Serbia. Data were collected using a specific questionnaire of 18 questions referring to the information on sociodemographic characteristics and the knowledge of organ donation. Results: The investigation enrolled 264 participants, of which 78% were women. The majority of study subjects had secondary medical education (64.4%), lived in an urban area (82.6%), were married (56.4%), and were predominantly Orthodox (87.1%) with their work experience between 5 and 10 years (29.9%) and 10 to 20 years (29.5%). The average knowledge score concerning organ donation was 29.03 (SD, 2.33; range, 23-34). There was a statistically significant difference in the scores between 2 groups formed according the length of service (P < .001) and the level of education (P = .019), which showed the strongest influence on nurses’ attitudes toward donation. Conclusion: This investigation showed that nurses did not express strong positive attitude toward this issue. Further education of nurses in the Serbian health care system focusing on transplantation and bequeathing of organs and tissues are warranted.","10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.01.031","00411345","||Vlaisavljevic Z.::0000-0002-8050-4705::600||Jankovic S.||Maksimović N.||Culafic M.||Stulic M.::0000-0002-9554-2106::600||Milovanovic T.||Oluic B.","Article","85080952846","2020-04-01"

During operation, cylinder heads are components that are exposed to multiaxial thermomechanical loads leading to fatigue. Therefore, predicting the lifetime of the cylinder heads exposed to such loads is one of the most important tasks to ensure engine quality, durability and safety. This paper is the continuation of a comprehensive research of the Lycoming IO-360-B1F aircraft engine cylinder head failure. The failure of this type has already occurred during flight and about 50 failures like this have been registered from around the world, some of them with a fatal outcome and therefore require detailed research. This research includes the numerical stress and fatigue analysis of the cylinder assembly exposed to high cycle mechanical and thermal loads that failed due to a crack appearance on the cylinder head. A 3D cylinder assembly model was created. The locations with the highest stress values, both mechanical and thermal, were determined using numerical analysis. Also, the lifetime of the cylinder assembly has been determined, i.e. an integrity assessment has been carried out which will contribute to the consideration of the crack appearance problem. Defining the coupled thermomechanical load of the cylinder assembly in the numerical analysis gives special significance to this paper. The results obtained will serve to analyze the crack propagation in the cylinder head which is going to be the subject of further research.","10.1016/j.engfailanal.2020.104453","13506307","||Vučetić N.||Jovicic G.||Krstic B.||Živkovič M.||Milovanović V.::0000-0003-3071-4728::600||Kacmarcik J.::0000-0002-5219-2062::600||Antunović R.","Article","85081181592","2020-04-01"

Introduction: Zonisamide is a benzisoxazole with 3-methanesulfonamide side chain, chemically unrelated with other anticonvulsants, and approved as mono-therapy of newly diagnosed focal epilepsy with or without secondary generalization in adults or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and above. Areas covered: Pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and the adverse effects of zonisamide are discussed in the article. The discussion is based on data from published preclinical studies, clinical trials, observational studies, systematic reviews, and approved summary of product characteristics. Expert opinion: Zonisamide is an anticonvulsant with multiple mechanisms of action on neuronal tissue, which achieves seizure freedom in more than 80% of patients with newly-onset focal epilepsy and in 6.2 to 18.1% of patients with focal onset seizures inadequately controlled by first-line anticonvulsants. Within the recommended dose range, it follows linear kinetic of elimination; it is metabolized in the liver by two cytochrome isoforms, so pharmacokinetic interactions are rare and with little clinical significance. Up to 10% of patients taking zonisamide will have problems with weight loss and more than 10% with irritability, confusion or depression, and long-lasting therapy may cause renal calculi in 1.2% of patients.","10.1080/17425255.2020.1736035","17425255","||Jankovic S.::0000-0002-1519-8828::600","Article","85080950498","2020-03-03"

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Estrogen signaling plays an important role in pituitary development and function. In sensitive rat or mice strains of both sexes, estrogen treatments promote lactotropic cell proliferation and induce the formation of pituitary adenomas (dominantly prolactin or growth-hormone-secreting ones). In male patients receiving estrogen, treatment does not necessarily result in pituitary hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia or adenoma development. In this review, we comprehensively analyze the mechanisms of estrogen action upon their application in male animal models comparing it with available data in human subjects. Sex-specific molecular targets of estrogen action in lactotropic (PRL) cells are highlighted in the context of their proliferative and secretory activity. In addition, putative effects of estradiol on the cellular/tumor microenvironment and the contribution of postnatal pituitary progenitor/stem cells and transdifferentiation processes to prolactinoma development have been analyzed. Finally, estrogen-induced morphological and hormone-secreting changes in pituitary thyrotropic (TSH) and adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) cells are discussed, as well as the putative role of the thyroid and/or glucocorticoid hormones in prolactinoma development, based on the current scarce literature.","10.3390/ijms21062024","16616596","||Šošić-Jurjević B.::0000-0001-6378-1930::600||Ajdžanovic V.||Miljic D.||Trifunović S.||Filipović B.||Sanja S.||Bolevich S.::0000-0002-1574-477X::600||Jakovljevic V.||Milosević V.","Review","85082087099","2020-03-02"

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This work investigates the fracture behavior of maraging steel specimens manufactured by the selective laser sintering (SLS) technology, in which a crack-like notch (sharp notch) was directly produced during the additive manufacturing (AM) process. For the evaluation of the fracture toughness, the inclined asymmetrical semi-circular specimen subjected to three points loading (IASCB) was used, allowing to cover a wide variety of Mode I and II combinations. The effectiveness of manufacturing crack-like notches via the SLS technique in metals was evaluated by comparing the obtained experimental results with the ones obtained with pre-cracks induced by fatigue loading. The investigation was carried out by using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique, that allowed the evaluation of the full displacement fields around the crack tip. The displacement field was then used to compute the stress intensity factors (SIFs) for various combinations of Mode I and II, via a fitting technique which relies on the Williams’ model for the displacement. The SIFs obtained in this way were compared to the results obtained with the conventional critical load method. The results showed that the discrepancy between the two methods reduces by ranging from Mode I to Mode II loading condition. Finally, the experimental SIFs obtained by the two methods were described by the mixed mode local stress criterium.","10.3390/met10030400","","||Campione I.||Brugo T.::0000-0001-9049-2747::600||Minak G.::0000-0003-4961-0961::600||Tomić J.||Bogojević N.::0000-0003-3951-3519::600||Kostic S.","Article","85082564483","2020-03-01"

Salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) has shown good potential in the diagnosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). However, a series of international studies have reported needs for improvements of the existing pSS scoring procedures in terms of inter/intra observer reliability before being established as standardized diagnostic tools. The present study aims to solve this problem by employing radiomics features and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to make the pSS scoring more objective and faster compared to human expert scoring. The assessment of AI algorithms was performed on a two-centric cohort, which included 600 SGUS images (150 patients) annotated using the original SGUS scoring system proposed in 1992 for pSS. For each image, we extracted 907 histogram-based and descriptive statistics features from segmented salivary glands. Optimal feature subsets were found using the genetic algorithm based wrapper approach. Among the considered algorithms (seven classifiers and five regressors), the best preforming was the multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier (κ = 0.7). The MLP over-performed average score achieved by the clinicians (κ = 0.67) by the considerable margin, whereas its reliability was on the level of human intra-observer variability (κ = 0.71). The presented findings indicate that the continuously increasing HarmonicSS cohort will enable further advancements in AI-based pSS scoring methods by SGUS. In turn, this may establish SGUS as an effective noninvasive pSS diagnostic tool, with the final goal to supplement current diagnostic tests.","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2923773","21682194","||Vukicevic A.||Filipović N.::0000-0001-9964-5615::600||Milic V.||Zabotti A.::0000-0002-0573-464X::600||Hočevar A.||De lucia O.::0000-0003-2304-6661::600||Filippou G.::0000-0002-1647-2083::600||Frangi A.::0000-0002-2675-528X::600||Tzioufas A.||De vita S.","Article","85081940812","2020-03-01"

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignant neoplasms. The aim of the study was to evaluate and correlate most important epidemiological and economic indicators of CRC in 11 selected Balkan countries. The number of new CRC cases was 56,960, and the highest 5-year CRC prevalence was in Slovenia, Croatia, and Greece. Age-standardized CRC incidence rates were highest in Slovenia, Serbia, and Croatia, and age-standardized mortality rates were highest in Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria. Current Health Expenditure as % of Gross Domestic Product was the highest in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. The GDP per capita levels have shown positive correlation with the CRC incidence rate and prevalence. Absolute numbers of new and death-related CRC cases and 5-year prevalence in absolute numbers have shown strong positive correlation with GDP in million current US$. It has been shown that various economic indicators can be linked to the rate of incidence and prevalence of the CRC patients in the selected Balkan countries. Therefore, economic factors can influence the epidemiology of CRC, and heavy CRC burden in the Balkan region may be one of the indexes of the economic development.","10.3389/fpubh.2020.00029","","||Vekić B.::0000-0002-2458-2282::600||Dragojević Simić V.||Jakovljevic M.::0000-0002-9160-6846::600||Kalezic M.||Zagorac Z.||Dragovic S.||Zivić R.||Pilipovic F.||Simic R.||Jovanovic D.||Milovanovic J.||Rancic N.::0000-0002-5122-8094::600","Article","85080890249","2020-02-18"

The subject of this article is a determination of the potential of the prohibition of unfair commercial practice, as an institution of consumer law, established to strengthen consumers' protection, to contribute to the achievement of corporate sustainability. The main objective of the paper is the identification of situations in which certain companies' actions may at the same time be considered as unsustainable and socially irresponsible behavior, as well as unfair commercial practice. There are three such characteristic situations that were the subject of thorough analysis in the paper: (1) company's constantly invoking to the concepts of corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in its marketing activities, which is essentially incorrect because the company in practice breaches some of the basic postulates of these concepts, (2) breach of company's code of conduct which contains the principles of corporate sustainability and CSR, and which the company has undertaken to be bound, (3) conducting many concrete acts which represent unfair commercial practice, and simultaneously have negative impact on the corporate sustainability and CSR. From the analysis of these three situations arises the conclusion that there is a possibility for indirect legal sanctioning of the unsustainable and socially irresponsible behavior of companies through the application of the consumer law rules on the prohibition of unfair commercial practice.","10.3390/su12031009","","||Mihajlovic B.","Article","85081283322","2020-02-01"

Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited. The design, synthesis, spectral and electrochemical characterization of a series of novel pyrrolidine derivatives have been described. The synthesis was achieved by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides and ferrocene-substituted chalcones, while detailed characterization of the compounds was performed by IR, NMR and elemental analyses, followed by X-ray diffraction experiment for one representative. The electrochemical properties of obtained ferrocene-containing heterocycles were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). These techniques revealed the quasi-reversible one-electron oxidation process. DNA-binding capacity of all products was studied using CV and DPV, highlighting a derivative with five times better binding affinity than the others. DFT calculations and molecular docking studies were carried out to gain more exhaustive insight into the type of interactions of the distinguished compound and the nucleic acid.","10.1149/1945-7111/ab68cc","00134651","||Pešić M.::0000-0002-3871-5795::600||Bugarinović J.::0000-0002-3561-6732::600||Minić A.::0000-0003-3902-2736::600||Bogdanović G.::0000-0002-4721-794X::600||Todosijević A.||Stevanović D.::0000-0003-3199-0775::600||Damljanović I.::0000-0001-5687-2885::600","Article","85081751226","2020-01-22"

During the braking process, a large part of the heat is accumulated by the disc, and therefore, it is essential that it has good cooling. In order to improve cooling and reduce the mass of the disc, nowadays more and more ventilated discs are applied, even on commercial vehicles. Not only does this design improve the cooling of automotive disc brakes, but their use significantly reduces the wear of the brake disc and brake pads. The aim of the paper is to reduce the mass of the disc and increase the mass flow of air through the disc, but not to disturb the mechanical characteristics of the brake disc. Optimization is done in the Ansys software package. By performed analysis, parameters that satisfy the goal of the paper are presented.

Chalcones, as a large group of organic compounds, are widely implemented in various types of anticancer therapeutics. These plant metabolites are present in fruits, vegetables, spices, and have anti-tumor, antiinflammation, immunomodulation, antibacterial and anti-oxidative activities, as well as many other pharmacological and biological effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate cytotoxic effects, type of cell death and mechanism of action of the newly synthesized vanillin based chalcone analogs, (CH1) and (CH2) on human colon cancer HCT-116 and noncancerous (control) MRC-5 cell lines. In order to compare the effects of vanillin based chalcone analogs on investigated cell lines, as reference substances cisplatin (cisPt) and dehydrozingerone (DHZ) were used. Investigation of antitumor effect of chalcone analogs on HCT-116 cells was carried out by three methods MTT assay, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis. The result of our investigation indicated that newly synthesized vanillin based chalcone analogs expressed powerful antitumor effect on cancer cells (HCT-116 cell line), while their effect on healthy cells (MRC-5 cell line) was not statistically significant. Vanillin based chalcone analogs caused overexpression and activation of mitochondrial Bax protein and caspase-3 in HCT-116 cells, indicating that their mechanism of antitumor action was mediated through activation of the inner apoptotic pathway. These results indicate possible usefulness of CH1 and CH2 in antitumor therapy whether through its direct cytotoxic effect or as adjuvant therapy. Our results indicate possible usefulness of CH1 and CH2 vanillin based chalcone analogs in antitumor therapy.","10.32383/appdr/112786","00016837","||Lukovic J.||Mitrovic M.||Popovic S.::0000-0002-7671-8575::600||Milosavljevic Z.||Stanojević-Pirković M.||An-Elković M.||Zelen I.||Sorak M.::0000-0002-3571-0091::600||Muškinja J.::0000-0002-0638-3423::600||Ratkovic Z.::0000-0002-7194-9163::600||Nikolic I.","Article","85082796014","2020-01-01"

Purpose: This study aims to investigate what are the capabilities and limits of external audit in detecting frauds in companies operating in the territory of the Republics: Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 51 certified auditors from Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were surveyed to analyze what are the most frequent warning signals of the existence of the frauds auditors encounter during the verification of company’s financial statements. Findings: The study indicated that the auditors of the Republic of Serbia more often encountered groundless overstatement of revenues compared with other countries, while regarding manipulative representation of inventories, the largest mean value and median are still among the auditors of the Republic of Serbia. Practical implications: Based on the research results, it can be concluded that it is necessary to expand the legal obligation and power of external auditors when, in financial statement auditing, they come to clear findings that indicate fraud. Expansion of external auditors’ powers would reduce their current limitations and expand the domain of action. Originality/value: Limitations in external auditors’ work prevent the processing of frauds. However, auditors’ analysis of financial statements and pointing to potential irregularities can be a good manner for the early detection and prevention of frauds in company’s operations.","10.1108/JFC-11-2019-0155","13590790","||Dimitrijević D.::0000-0001-8049-9451::600||Jovković B.::0000-0003-2433-0963::600||Milutinovic S.","Article","85081546540","2020-01-01"

The presence of vanillic acid in pumpkin seeds was proven using HPLC analysis. Computational optimization of the extraction shows that for the concentration of ethanol 40% and solmodul: V/m=20, the optimum condition for the extraction of vanillic acid from pumpkin seeds was 100 min and 450C. The estimation of fitting for each kinetic model to the experimental kinetic data was performed using the root mean square, standard deviation, and the correlation coefficient. Ponomarev model was shown as the most suitable with the highest accuracy among the six considered kinetic models. The enthalpy and entropy changes were positive, while the Gibbs free energy was negative and decreased when temperature increased during the thermodynamic analysis. Therefore, the extraction of vanillic acid from pumpkin seeds was endothermic, spontaneous, and irreversible.","10.1515/chem-2020-0001","","||Mitić M.::0000-0002-1310-0540::600||Janković S.||Mašković P.::0000-0001-7566-2840::600||Arsic B.||Mitić J.||Ickovski J.","Article","85081317514","2020-01-01"

In sensitive plum (Prunus domestica L.) cultivars, PPV causes foliar symptoms, fruits deformation, changes in the chemical composition of fruits and premature fruit drop. Fruits of ‘Čačanska lepotica’ plum cultivar were collected from an experimental orchard in locality Čačak. Samples were collected from 15 trees (5 infected with PPV-D, 5 infected with PPV-Rec and 5 from PPV-free trees). Trees for sampling were selected after the RT-PCR analysis of the trees from the plantation using PPV strain-specific primers. The fruits were picked at five different terms at seven-days interval during the entire maturation stage. All tested samples, 10 PPV-infected and 5 uninfected, were further chemically analyzed. The analyses included determination of soluble solid content, titratable acidity and total phenolic content.

New anticancer platinum(II) compounds simultaneously targeting tumor cells and tumor-derived neoangiogenesis, with new DNA interacting mode and large therapeutic window are appealing alternative to improve efficacy of clinical platinum chemotherapeutics. Herein, we describe three novel dinuclear [{Pt(en)Cl}2(μ-L)]2+ complexes with different pyridine-like bridging ligands (L), 4,4′-bipyridine (Pt1), 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (Pt2) and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene (Pt3), which highly, positively charged aqua derivatives, [{Pt(en)(H2O)}2(μ-L)]4+, interact with the phosphate backbone forming DNA-Pt adducts with an unique and previously undescribed binding mode, called a minor groove covering. The results of this study suggested that the new binding mode of the aqua-Pt(II) complexes with DNA could be attributed to the higher anticancer activities of their chloride analogues. All three compounds, particularly complex [{Pt(en)Cl}2(μ-4,4′-bipy)]Cl2·2H2O (4,4′-bipy is 4,4′-bipyridine) (Pt1), overcame cisplatin resistance in vivo in the zebrafish–mouse melanoma xenograft model, showed much higher therapeutic potential than antiangiogenic drug sunitinib malate, while effectively blocking tumor neovascularization and melanoma cell metastasis. Overall therapeutic profile showed new dinuclear Pt(II) complexes could be novel, effective and safe anticancer agents. Finally, the correlation with the structural characteristics of these complexes can serve as a useful tool for developing new and more effective anticancer drugs.","10.1007/s00775-020-01770-7","09498257","||Franich A.||Živković M.::0000-0002-1467-8002::600||Ilic-Tomic T.||Dordević I.||Nikodinović-Runić J.::0000-0002-2553-977X::600||Pavic A.||Janjić G.||Rajkovic S.::0000-0002-7135-4063::600","Article","85081894121","2020-01-01"

Purpose: This study was conducted to assess the impact of structured education of breast cancer patients receiving capecitabine treatment on depression, anxiety and stress. Methods: The study included 142 breast cancer patients who were receiving capecitabine at the Institute of Oncology and Radiology of Serbia in 2016 and 2017. Patients were randomized into two study groups: the experimental group had additional individual, structured, specific education, before chemotherapy by using a Serbian version of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Oral Agent Teaching Tool (MOATT V1.0), while the control group had usual standard education. Patients were followed up for 3 weeks, during their first chemotherapy cycle. Two instruments were used: specifically designed, for the purpose of this study, sociodemographic questionnaire and the Serbian version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS 21) self-report questionnaire. Results: Before starting capecitabine and education, breast cancer patients with metastatic disease had symptoms of depression (29.58%), anxiety (35.92%) and stress (21.13%), mostly mild and moderate. These symptoms were decreased in the whole group of patients after the first and the third week from education, with significant difference in depression and anxiety. Depression, anxiety and stress were decreased significantly in experimental group of patients from the initial measurement to the one-week and three-week follow-up, comparing to the control group of patients. Conclusions: Structured education has a significant positive impact on depression, anxiety and stress symptoms of breast cancer patients receiving capecitabine. Therefore, it may be recommended for use in everyday clinical practice.","","11070625","||Tadic D.||Djukić Dejanović S.||Tomasevic Z.||Djoković D.::0000-0002-2114-2011::600||Janjić V.","Article","85081617731","2020-01-01"

Regional lymph nodes (LN)s represent important immunological barriers in spreading of malignant tumors. However, they are the most frequent early metastatic site in melanoma. Immunomodulatory agents including cytokines have been included in therapy of melanoma and have shown severe side effects and toxicity. In this sense, there is a growing need for bringing these agents to further in vitro testing that may enlighten aspects of their regional application. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15, the two cytokines with similar immune-enhancing effects, on the expression of activating NKG2D, inhibitory CD158a and CD158b receptors on CD8+ T, NKT-like and NK cell lymphocyte subsets from regional LNs of melanoma patients. In this study, we showed significant effects of IL-2 and IL-15 cytokine treatments on the expression of activating NKG2D and on inhibitory CD158a and CD158b receptors on lymphocytes, CD8+ T, NKT-like and NK cell lymphocyte subsets originating from regional LNs of melanoma patients. Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-15 by inducing the expression of NKG2D activating receptor on innate and on adaptive lymphocyte subsets and by augmenting NK cell antitumor cytotoxicity that correlated with the cytokine-induced NKG2D expression, increased antitumor potential of immune cells in regional LNs of melanoma patients irrespective of LN involvement. These findings indicate the importance of immune cell population from regional LNs of melanoma patients in the development of immune intervention strategies that may if applied locally increase antitumor potential to the level that controls tumor progressions.","10.1007/s12253-018-0444-2","12194956","||Vuletić A.||Jovanic I.||Jurišić V.::0000-0001-6525-128X::600||Milovanovic Z.||Nikolić S.||Spurnic I.||Konjević G.","Article","85082791917","2020-01-01"

The following oxidative stress markers were measured spectrophotometrically: superoxide anion radical (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO−), index of lipid peroxidation measured as TBARS, reduced glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase. The study has shown that Olanzapine treatment was associated with increased release of pro-oxidants and diminished activity of anti-oxidant markers. Additional supplementation with PD and FA succeeded in abolishing the negative influence in most of the measured parameters. However, these beneficial impacts were stronger in the case of their separate application, which could be the practical and clinical importance of these results.","10.1007/s11010-020-03718-6","03008177","||Mitrovic M.||Nikolic Turnic T.||Zivkovic V.||Pavic Z.||Vranic A.::0000-0002-6429-7953::600||Srejovic I.||Sretenovic J.||Bolevich S.::0000-0002-1574-477X::600||Jakovljevic V.","Article","85082336290","2020-01-01"

Active, male college students (N=22) completed 3-, 4-, and 5-a-side handball game formats across three separate sessions following a repeated-measures, crossover design. Heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (BLa), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), distance covered, and frequency of accelerations/decelerations were monitored during games. Each game format elicited vigorous intensities with a mean HR in the range 82–85%HRmax and post-game BLa in the range 3.9–4.4 mmol·L-1. No significant differences (P>0.05) in absolute (ηp2=0.40), relative mean HR (ηp2=0.43), BLa (ηp2=0.16), total distance (ηp2=0.32), total accelerations (ηp2=0.23), or total decelerations (ηp2=0.23) were observed between game formats. A significant effect was observed for RPE (ηp2=0.51), where 3-a-side games elicited a higher RPE than 5-a-side games (P=0.03, large). Modifying player number has a negligible effect on the physiological and activity demands encountered during recreational handball games. Recreational handball consisting of 3–5 players imposes similar intermittent workloads, resulting in vigorous physiological responses concomitant with those recommended for overall health improvements as part of regular training.","10.5114/biolsport.2020.92516","0860021X","||Stojiljković N.||Scanlan A.::0000-0002-0750-8697::600||Dalbo V.::0000-0002-5944-7558::600||Stanković R.||Milanovic Z.||Stojanović E.","Article","85082014673","2020-01-01"

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor-(TKI-) based therapy revolutionized the overall survival and the quality of life in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, EGFR is a highly polymorphic and mutation-prone gene, with over 1200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Since the role of EFGR polymorphism on the treatment outcome is still a matter of debate, this research analyzed the available literature data, according to the PRISMA guidelines for meta-analyses. Research includes PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and 14 of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) electronic databases in order to provide quantitative assessment of the association between ten investigated EGFR SNPs and the survival of NSCLC patients. The pooled HR and their 95% CI for OS and PFS for different EGFR polymorphisms using a random or fixed effect model based on the calculated heterogeneity between the studies was applied. The longest and the shortest median OSs were reported for the homozygous wild genotype and a variant allele carriers for rs712829 (-216G>T), respectively. Quantitative synthesis in our study shows that out of ten investigated EGFR SNPs (rs11543848, rs11568315, rs11977388, rs2075102, rs2227983, rs2293347, rs4947492, rs712829, rs712830, and rs7809028), only four, namely, rs712829 (-216G>T), rs11568315 (CA repeat), rs2293347 (D994D), and rs4947492, have been reported to affect the outcome of TKI-based NSCLC treatment. Of these, only-216G>T and variable CA repeat polymorphisms have been confirmed by meta-analysis of available data to significantly affect OS and PFS in gefitinib-or erlotinib-treated NSCLC patients.","10.1155/2020/1973241","16878450","||Jurišić V.::0000-0001-6525-128X::600||Vukovic V.||Obradović J.::0000-0002-8853-6525::600||Gulyaeva L.::0000-0002-7693-3777::600||Kushlinsky N.::0000-0002-3898-4127::600||Djordjevic N.::0000-0003-4525-6723::600","Article","85083067061","2020-01-01"

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their potential for differentiation into alveolar epithelial cells and their immunosuppressive characteristics, are considered a new therapeutic agent in cell-based therapy of inflammatory lung disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since most of the MSC-mediated beneficent effects were the consequence of their paracrine action, herewith, we investigated the effects of a newly designed MSC-derived product "Exosome-derived Multiple Allogeneic Protein Paracrine Signaling (Exo-d-MAPPS)" in the attenuation of chronic airway inflammation by using an animal model of COPD (induced by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke (CS)) and clinical data obtained from Exo-d-MAPPS-Treated COPD patients. Exo-d-MAPPS contains a high concentration of immunomodulatory factors which are capable of attenuating chronic airway inflammation, including soluble TNF receptors I and II, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products. Accordingly, Exo-d-MAPPS significantly improved respiratory function, downregulated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1β, IL-12, and IFN-γ), increased serum concentration of immunosuppressive IL-10, and attenuated chronic airway inflammation in CS-exposed mice. The cellular makeup of the lungs revealed that Exo-d-MAPPS treatment attenuated the production of inflammatory cytokines in lung-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer and natural killer T cells and alleviated the antigen-presenting properties of lung-infiltrated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, Exo-d-MAPPS promoted the expansion of immunosuppressive IL-10-producing alternatively activated macrophages, regulatory DCs, and CD4+FoxP3+T regulatory cells in inflamed lungs which resulted in the attenuation of chronic airway inflammation. In a similar manner, as it was observed in an animal model, Exo-d-MAPPS treatment significantly improved the pulmonary status and quality of life of COPD patients. Importantly, Exo-d-MAPPS was well tolerated since none of the 30 COPD patients reported any adverse effects after Exo-d-MAPPS administration. In summing up, we believe that Exo-d-MAPPS could be considered a potentially new therapeutic agent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory lung diseases whose efficacy should be further explored in large clinical trials.","10.1155/2020/3153891","22107177","||Harrell C.||Miloradovic D.||Sadikot R.||Fellabaum C.||Markovic B.||Miloradovic D.||Acovic A.||Djonov V.||Arsenijevic N.::0000-0002-2107-3490::600||Volarevic V.::0000-0002-9057-9460::600","Article","85082842043","2020-01-01"

Taken into consideration that oxidative stress response after preconditioning with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) and moderate physical activity has still not been clarified, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of PDEIs alone or in combination with physical activity, on systemic redox status. The study was carried out on 96 male Wistar albino rats classified into two groups. The first group included animals exposed only to pharmacological preconditioning (PreC) maneuver (sedentary control (CTRL, 1 ml/day saline, n=12), nicardipine (6 mg/kg/day of NIC, n=12), vinpocetine (10 mg/kg/day of VIN, n=12), and nimodipine (NIM 10 mg/kg/day of, n=12). The second included animals exposed to preconditioning with moderate-intensity training (MIT) on treadmill for 8 weeks. After 5 weeks from the start of training, the animals were divided into four subgroups depending on the medication to be used for pharmacological PreC: moderate-intensity training (MIT+ 1 ml/day saline, n=12), nicardipine (MIT+ 6 mg/kg/day of NIC, n=12), vinpocetine (MIT+ 10 mg/kg/day of VIN, n=12), and nimodipine (MIT+ 10 mg/kg/day of NIM, n=12). After three weeks of pharmacological preconditioning, the animals were sacrificed. The following oxidative stress parameters were measured spectrophotometrically: nitrites (NO2-), superoxide anion radical (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), index of lipid peroxidation (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione (GSH). Our results showed that PDE1 and MIT preconditioning decreased the release of prooxidants and improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes thus preventing systemic oxidative stress.","10.1155/2020/6361703","19420900","||Ristic J.||Folić M.::0000-0002-0807-3488::600||Radonjic K.||Rosić M.||Bolevich S.::0000-0002-1574-477X::600||Alisultanovich O.||Draginic N.||Andjic M.||Jeremić J.::0000-0002-8084-3264::600||Milosavljevic I.||Zivkovic V.||Jakovljevic V.","Article","85080028598","2020-01-01"

Efficient fertilizer management in maize production is based on supplying adequate amounts of nutrients for optimum economic yield, while minimizing losses to the environment. Exploiting genotypic differences in fertilizers use is required for achieving nutrient-use efficiency and higher yield. This two-year field study was designed to evaluate the influence of different fertilizer combinations on nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) uptake patterns, and yield in novel maize hybrids. Four divergent maize hybrids NS 4023, NS 6010, NS 6030 and NS 640 were grown under eight NPK combinations: 1: P60K60; 2: P60K60 + Nmin spring; 3: P60K60 + N40autumn + Nmin spring; 4: P60K60 + N60spring; 5: P60K60 + N100spring; 6: P60K60 + N40autumn + N60spring + Zn; 7: P60K60 + N40autumn + N80spring + Zn; 8: P60K60 + N160spring + Zn in both years of study. Different NPK combinations significantly improved NPK contents in leaves and grains along with substantial increase in 1000-grain weight, grain yield, grain protein contents and net returns of all tested hybrids; however, hybrids behaved differently in this regard. The highest N content in maize leaves was found in NS 4023 (2.39%), potassium in NS 6030 and NS 6010 (1.73%). Fertilizer combinations with N addition in autumn and spring + Zn, fertilization based on N correction in spring, showed positive effects on N content in grain and leaves; however P contents in leaves were not affected with fertilization systems. Moreover, P and K concentrations in leaves and grains decreased, which may be associated to better efficiency of maize hybrids. The highest yield was obtained with P60K60 + N40 autumn + N60 spring + Zn followed by fertilizer combinations, P60K60 + N40 autumn + N80 spring + Zn and P60K60 + N40 autumn + Nmin spring. The highest net benefit of 2091.6 and 2043.9 $ ha-1 was obtained in treatments: P60K60 + N40 autumn + N60 spring + Zn and P60K60 + N40 autumn + Nmin spring. In conclusion, the amount and timings of nutrients application significantly affect the yield and could help in determination of genotype potential. Moreover, the treatment combination, P60K60 + N40 autumn + N60 spring + Zn harvested maximum maize yield along with highest net benefits and benefit: cost ratio.","10.17957/IJAB/15.1396","15608530","||Dalovic I.||Šeremešić S.::0000-0003-4467-9601::600||Chen Y.::0000-0003-0798-8683::600||Milošev D.||Biberdžić M.::0000-0002-7259-3357::600||Paunović A.","Article","85082859584","2020-01-01"

Objectives: To evaluate sex-specific prediction significance of syncope for 30-day mortality in PE patients. Methods: A multicentric, retrospective, observational, registry-based study on consecutive PE patients was undertaken. Patients were allocated into either a men or a women group before comparisons were made between patients with syncope and those without syncope. A sex-related prediction of the significance of syncope for 30-day mortality was evaluated. Results: Overall 588 patients [294 (50%) men and 294 (50%) women] were included within the study. Among men, patients with syncope were older and had significantly higher parameters of increased 30-day mortality then patients without syncope. Within the same group, however, difference in the 30-day mortality rate was not significant (log rank P =.942). In contrast to the men, fewer differences in admission characteristics were noticed among women, but those with syncope had significantly increased signs of the right ventricular dysfunction and increased 30-day mortality rate, as compared with those without syncope (log rank P =.025). After adjustment for age in a Cox regression analysis, syncope was a significant predictor of 30-day mortality in women (HR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.02-3.95). Conclusion: Although syncope is associated with other predictors of higher early mortality in both male and female PE patients, only in women it is a significant predictor of 30-day mortality.","10.1111/crj.13179","17526981","||Dzudovic B.||Subotic B.||Novicic N.||Matijasevic J.||Trobok J.||Miric M.||Šalinger-Martinović S.::0000-0001-9657-1665::600||Stanojevic D.||Nikolic M.||Miloradović V.||Markovic-Nikolic N.||Dekleva M.||Lepojevic Stefanovic D.||Kos L.||Kovacevic-Preradovic T.||Obradović S.","Article","85081717019","2020-01-01"

Abstract: An active coating, composed of a mixture of nanocrystals of RuO2 with the rutile structure and nanocrystals of metal Pt, was thermally synthetized on a titanium substrate. Cyclic voltammograms and polarization curves showed that the catalytic activity of the coating for the formic acid oxidation in an acidic solution increased with an increase in the RuO2 content, reaching the maximum value at 50 mol % RuO2. Additionally, further increase in the RuO2 content resulted in a decline of the catalytic activity. The catalytic effect was attributed to a bifunctional mechanism and an electronic effect. The bifunctional mechanism had a dominant role and was based on the fact that Ru–OH species were formed on Ru atoms of RuO2 at more negative potentials than on Pt. Those species oxidized the adsorbed COad and HCOOad—species on adjacent Pt atoms of clusters of metal Pt and thus discharge them to oxidize new HCOOH molecules.","10.1134/S1023193519120164","10231935","||Miroslav Spasojević||Ribić-Zelenović L.||Spasojević M.||TriŠović T.::0000-0003-2400-5984::600","Article","85077214622","2019-12-01"

Objective: Stage II melanoma patients have high risk for regional and distant metastases and may benefit from novel therapeutic strategies. To clarify the role of NK cells in Stage II melanoma, we characterized the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and the expression of various activating and inhibitory receptors in high-risk cutaneous melanoma patients (Stages IIB and IIC) compared to low-risk patients (Stage IA). Materials and Methods: Native and cytokine-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used for functional and phenotypical analyses. Results: Compared to Stage IA-B patients, Stage IIB-C patients showed significantly decreased NK cell activity, as well as decreased expression of the activating NKG2D and CD161 receptors, most likely due to increased serum levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-β1 in these patients. Interestingly, treatment of periperal blood mononuclear cells with IFN-α, IL-2, IL-12 or the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 significantly induced NK cell activity for both groups of melanoma patients. However, only low-risk patients had a significant increase in the expression of the NKG2D receptor after in vitro treatment with IFN-α, as well as an significant increase in the expression of CD161 after treatment with IFN-α or IL-12. Although IL-2 induced the expression of NKG2D in both groups of patients, this increase was significantly lower in high-risk melanoma. Conclusion: NK cell parameters may be useful as biomarkers of disease progression in localized melanoma patients. Our results further suggest that the use of NK cell-activating cytokines in combination with inhibitors of immunosuppressive factors like TGF-β1 could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of high-risk cutaneous melanoma patients.","10.1684/ecn.2019.0440","11485493","||Martinović K.||Milićević M.||Larsen A.||Dzodić R.::0000-0002-3041-7339::600||Jurišić V.::0000-0001-6525-128X::600||Konjević G.||Vuletić A.","Article","85081001741","2019-12-01"

Although an accurate diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients is thus of crucial importance, the diagnostic management of suspected PE is still challenging. A 60-year-old man with chest pain and expectoration of blood was admitted to the Department of Cardiology, General Hospital in Cuprija, Serbia. After physical examination and laboratory analyses, the diagnosis of Right side pleuropne monia and acute pulmonary embolism was established. Clinically, patient was hemodynamically stable, auscultative slightly weaker respiratory sound right basal, without pretibial edema. Laboratory: Creactive protein (CRP) 132.9 mg/L, Leukocytes (Le) 18.9x109/L, Erythrocytes (Er) 3.23x1012/L, Haemoglobin (Hgb) 113 g/L, Platelets (Plt) 79x109/L, D-dimer 35.2. On the third day after admission, D-dimer was increased and platelet count was decreased (Plt up to 62x109/L). According to Wells’ rules, score was 2.5 (without symptoms on admission), a normal clinical finding with clinical manifestation of hemoptysis and chest pain, which represents the intermediate level of clinical probability of PE. After the recidive of PE, Wells’ score was 6.5. In summary, this study suggests that Wells’ score, based on a patient’s risk for pulmonary embolism, is a valuable guidance for decision-making in combination with knowledge and experience of clinicians. Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being consiered.","10.1515/SJECR-2017-0061","18208665","||Panic D.||Todorovic A.||Stanojević M.||Ćupić V.","Article","85082729569","2019-09-01"

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 license Background: Comprehensive and comparable estimates of health spending in each country are a key input for health policy and planning, and are necessary to support the achievement of national and international health goals. Previous studies have tracked past and projected future health spending until 2040 and shown that, with economic development, countries tend to spend more on health per capita, with a decreasing share of spending from development assistance and out-of-pocket sources. We aimed to characterise the past, present, and predicted future of global health spending, with an emphasis on equity in spending across countries. Methods: We estimated domestic health spending for 195 countries and territories from 1995 to 2016, split into three categories—government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private health spending—and estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2018. We estimated future scenarios of health spending using an ensemble of linear mixed-effects models with time series specifications to project domestic health spending from 2017 through 2050 and DAH from 2019 through 2050. Data were extracted from a broad set of sources tracking health spending and revenue, and were standardised and converted to inflation-adjusted 2018 US dollars. Incomplete or low-quality data were modelled and uncertainty was estimated, leading to a complete data series of total, government, prepaid private, and out-of-pocket health spending, and DAH. Estimates are reported in 2018 US dollars, 2018 purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars, and as a percentage of gross domestic product. We used demographic decomposition methods to assess a set of factors associated with changes in government health spending between 1995 and 2016 and to examine evidence to support the theory of the health financing transition. We projected two alternative future scenarios based on higher government health spending to assess the potential ability of governments to generate more resources for health. Findings: Between 1995 and 2016, health spending grew at a rate of 4·00% (95% uncertainty interval 3·89–4·12) annually, although it grew slower in per capita terms (2·72% [2·61–2·84]) and increased by less than $1 per capita over this period in 22 of 195 countries. The highest annual growth rates in per capita health spending were observed in upper-middle-income countries (5·55% [5·18–5·95]), mainly due to growth in government health spending, and in lower-middle-income countries (3·71% [3·10–4·34]), mainly from DAH. Health spending globally reached $8·0 trillion (7·8–8·1) in 2016 (comprising 8·6% [8·4–8·7] of the global economy and $10·3 trillion [10·1–10·6] in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars), with a per capita spending of US$5252 (5184–5319) in high-income countries, $491 (461–524) in upper-middle-income countries, $81 (74–89) in lower-middle-income countries, and $40 (38–43) in low-income countries. In 2016, 0·4% (0·3–0·4) of health spending globally was in low-income countries, despite these countries comprising 10·0% of the global population. In 2018, the largest proportion of DAH targeted HIV/AIDS ($9·5 billion, 24·3% of total DAH), although spending on other infectious diseases (excluding tuberculosis and malaria) grew fastest from 2010 to 2018 (6·27% per year). The leading sources of DAH were the USA and private philanthropy (excluding corporate donations and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation). For the first time, we included estimates of China's contribution to DAH ($644·7 million in 2018). Globally, health spending is projected to increase to $15·0 trillion (14·0–16·0) by 2050 (reaching 9·4% [7·6–11·3] of the global economy and $21·3 trillion [19·8–23·1] in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars), but at a lower growth rate of 1·84% (1·68–2·02) annually, and with continuing disparities in spending between countries. In 2050, we estimate that 0·6% (0·6–0·7) of health spending will occur in currently low-income countries, despite these countries comprising an estimated 15·7% of the global population by 2050. The ratio between per capita health spending in high-income and low-income countries was 130·2 (122·9–136·9) in 2016 and is projected to remain at similar levels in 2050 (125·9 [113·7–138·1]). The decomposition analysis identified governments’ increased prioritisation of the health sector and economic development as the strongest factors associated with increases in government health spending globally. Future government health spending scenarios suggest that, with greater prioritisation of the health sector and increased government spending, health spending per capita could more than double, with greater impacts in countries that currently have the lowest levels of government health spending. Interpretation: Financing for global health has increased steadily over the past two decades and is projected to continue increasing in the future, although at a slower pace of growth and with persistent disparities in per-capita health spending between countries. Out-of-pocket spending is projected to remain substantial outside of high-income countries. Many low-income countries are expected to remain dependent on development assistance, although with greater government spending, larger investments in health are feasible. In the absence of sustained new investments in health, increasing efficiency in health spending is essential to meet global health targets.

Aging is a natural, time-dependent process characterized by irreversible changes in the molecules, cells, tissues, and organs. It occurs as a result of cumulative damage at different levels of the organization, in particular by damaging proteins and DNA. There is no single definition, nor a unique attitude about when and how age arises and what are its causes. The process is extremely complex and most likely a consequence of the effects of different mechanisms (not only genetic but also acquired) that lead to disrupt homeostasis, reduce stress resistance and the more frequent occurrence of the disease. There are many classifications of theories about aging and they often contradict one another. No one theory is sufficiently able to explain the process of aging. The aim of this work is to analyze the different aspects, main characteristics of the aging, individual differences in the speed of this process and theories about the mechanisms of aging.","10.19272/201911402006","00356050","||Stanić S.||Matic S.::0000-0003-4570-4370::600","Article","85081086466","2019-01-01"

Unsaturated polyester resins (UPR) are among the most commercially important thermosetting matrix materials for composites. This chapter summarizes the importance of the thermal and rheological properties of UPR. The kinetics and mechanisms of thermal degradation (for both inert and reactive atmospheres) are presented. A little information about the toxicity of the major thermal degradation products is given. The main parameters affecting thermal stability (prepolymer structure, styrene content, cure regime, fillers, and reinforcements) are summarized. A comprehensive study of the methods of improving thermal stability and flame retardancy with a special emphasis on nonhalogenated flame retardants is presented. Bearing in mind that the rheological characteristics of UPR govern and limit their usage potential, a comprehensive study of the parameters affecting the viscosity of UPR composites (thickening and thixotropic agents, low profile additives, fillers, and reinforcements) is presented. Also, briefly introduced and described are the main processing techniques with special emphasis on the rheological requirements for each technique. Finally, some rheological concerns and challenges for the development of fully bio-based UPRs are described.","10.1016/B978-0-12-816129-6.00015-6","","||Spasojević P.","Chapter","85082618198","2019-01-01"

During 2018 and 2019 we ad hoc investigated fruit weight, chemical composition and antioxidant activity of five strawberry cultivars ('Irma' as a day-neutral cultivar, and 'Clery', 'Roxana' 'Asia' and an 'Unknown' genotype as short-day strawberries). By ANOVA and multivariate analysis (PCA), differences were observed between cultivars based on the fruit weight, contents of soluble solids, acidity, maturity indexes, main phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. Results showed that 'Roxana' had the largest fruit at the same growing and environmental conditions. The highest soluble solids content (SSC), acidity and ripening and taste indexes, phenolic compounds had 'Clery' and 'Asia', respectively. 'Asia' is the cultivar with the highest antioxidant capacity. The poorest evaluated properties were shown by the 'Unknown' genotype, followed by 'Irma'. Season (year) had more influence on fruit weight, acidity, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity whereas effect on other properties was not significant. Interaction cultivar x year had significant effect on all evaluated properties with exception of fruit weight. Correlation matrix indicated significant positive or negative correlations between most primary and secondary metabolites in fruit of strawberries.

Tree survival was registered from 2011 to 2018. The orchard was established in autumn 2011 at a 5.5 m × 3 m planting distance. Apricots on Myrobalan had strong growth, lower yield and poorest fruit quality traits in most cases in comparison to St. Julien A and Pumiselect. Pumiselect showed a good capacity to reduce tree growth, increased yield, fruit weight, flesh rate, soluble solids content and ripening index. St. Julien A exhibited similar influences as Pumiselect. In the case of genotypes, 'Novosadska Rodna' had higher vigour, lower yield, better physical, but poorest chemical properties of fruit in comparison to 'NS 4' and 'NS 6' genotypes.

During the three years under study, the commercial wines from the variety 'Vranac' reported a total polyphenols content varying from 1634 mg/l to 2722 mg/l. Total anthocyanins contents varied between 439 and 586 mg/l, while cathechins contents ranged from 230 to 307 mg/l. The vintage year caused variance in the data obtained. While only small variances were verified in the vintages of 2008 and 2009, considerable variations were observed in 2010. For instance, anthocyanins contents were lower and cathechins contents increased. Such variations could be ascribed to the edaphoclimatic conditions in each specific year. From the results obtained, it was possible to group the wines according to vintage year, and only one commercial wine remained separated from the other wines, due to its consistent composition during this three-year study. These results obtained from PCA, allow the conclusion that vintage years cause higher differentiation in the wines' composition than their cultivation site.","","00075922","||Šćepanović R.||Madžgalj V.||Vukoslavljević V.","Article","85069517273","2019-01-01"

The deep prediction neural network is built on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a variant of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Especially, the feature of a frame is the output of CNN, which is instead of the hand-crafted feature. First, the feature of a short video clip is obtained through CNN. Second, the predicted feature of the next frame can be gained by LSTM. Finally, the prediction error is introduced to detect that a frame is abnormal or not after the feature of the frame is achieved. Experimental results of global abnormal event detection show the effectiveness of our deep prediction neural network.

The neonatal type of coarctation is characterized by the presence of the ductal sling and coarctational shelf placed proximally in relation to the ductal orifice. Those morphological features are not described in detail yet from immunohistochemical and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) aspects, so the aim of this study was to investigate the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) phenotype in aortic intimal thickening, presence of inflammatory cells and contents of intimal and medial, and adventitial connective tissue. We examined samples of coarctation segments excised at surgery after end-to-end anastomosis from 30 patients, ages from 14 days to three months, histochemicaly, immunocytochemically and by TEM. In all samples, it is noticed focal intimal thickening on the posterior aortic wall, with accumulation of SMCs, which show immunoreactivity on alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vimentin (but not on desmin) and also expressed proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and S-100 protein. At TEM analysis, those SMCs show a fibroblast-like morphology, so their functions could be to proliferate and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) components (a synthetic phenotype). In all studied samples of the coarctation, on the posterior wall, the immunocytochemical and TEM examination revealed the presence of SMCs of the synthetic phenotype. Results also showed an increase of the cell number in intima of this part of aortic wall, followed by proliferated SMCs in inner media and absence of inflammatory cells. This finding suggests that proliferation of the SMCs, their synthetic activity and increase of the cell number could lead to formation of the intimal thickening on the posterior wall.","","12200522","||Tanaskovic I.::0000-0002-1877-3250::600||Ilic S.||Jurišić V.::0000-0001-6525-128X::600||Lackovic M.||Milosavljevic Z.||Stankovic V.::0000-0002-8041-3491::600||Aleksic A.||Sazdanovic M.","Article","85082979256","2019-01-01"

"+","123456789/7294","Comparative thermal buckling analysis of functionally graded plate","A thermal buckling analysis of functionally graded thick rectangular plates according to von Karman nonlinear theory is presented. The material properties of the functionally graded plate, except for the Poisson's ratio, were assumed to be graded in the thickness direction, according to a power-law distribution, in terms of the volume fractions of the metal and ceramic constituents. Formulations of equilibrium and stability equations are derived using the high order shear deformation theory based on different types of shape functions. Analytical method for determination of the critical buckling temperature for uniform increase of temperature, linear and nonlinear change of temperature across thickness of a plate is developed. Numerical results were obtained in Matlab software using combinations of symbolic and numeric values. The paper presents comparative results of critical buckling temperature for different types of shape functions. The accuracy of the formulation presented is verified by comparing to results available from the literature.","10.2298/TSCI160614182C","03549836","||Čukanović D.||Bogdanovic G.||Radaković A.::0000-0002-7355-7403::600||Milosavljevic D.||Veljovic L.||Balac I.","Article","85082348184","2016-01-01"
